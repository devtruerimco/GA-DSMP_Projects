## Project Overview

### Problem statement
Predict the price of a new lego product before its price is revealed so that you can budget it from your revenue. Since (luckily!), you are a data scientist in the making. This dataset contains information on lego sets scraped from lego.com. 

Each observation is a different lego set with various features like how many pieces in the set, rating for the set, number of reviews per set etc. Your aim is to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a set.

### The dataset contains the following 10 features:
- ages
- list_price	
- num_reviews	
- piece_count	
- play_star_rating	
- review_difficulty	
- star_rating	
- theme_name	
- val_star_rating	
- country
